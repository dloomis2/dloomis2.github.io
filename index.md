# David Loomis' CPSC 120 Portfolio

##### I am a third year transfer student currently going for my Bachelors Degree in computer science with a cyber security focus. This is my first time dealing with programming and I am really starting to enjoy it.

## My Favorite Labs in CPSC 120L:

* Lab 7, Part One
  
  This lab was a great way to utilize the boolean logic that we learned in lecture. I had fun writing the functions and testing out everything. I like how the program also included commandline arguments to add even more complexity to the project.


* Lab 8, Part Two
  
  This part of the lab was very short, but the result was awesome. We utilized a nested for-loop to create a pattern in the terminal. This one stood out to me because I had tried to make a program like this on my own a while ago but I couldn't figure it out. This lab showed me the logic behind it and how the nested loop worked with each iteration.

* Lab 9. Part Two

  My favorite part of this lab was the `secrets.cc` file. The usage of the `#include <fstream>` header file was a good introduction to working with filestreams. I really liked the result of this program and made me want to create my own project that can deal with writing to a file.
